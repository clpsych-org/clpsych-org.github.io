## The 10th Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: understanding the mental health state – going beyond classification

Since 2014, CLPsych has brought together researchers in computational linguistics and NLP, who use computational methods to better understand human language, infer meaning and intention, and predict individuals’ characteristics and potential behavior, with mental health practitioners and researchers, who are focused on psychopathology and neurological health and engage directly with the needs of providers and their patients. This workshop’s distinctly interdisciplinary nature has improved the exchange of knowledge, fostered collaboration, and increased the visibility of mental health as a problem domain in NLP.

Together, we hope to be able to advance the common goal of using human language as a tool to better understand emotional and mental state, and to reduce emotional suffering and the potential for self-harm. In this year, we will focus on the theme: *understanding the mental health state and its changes as opposed to focusing on one final label or output.*
