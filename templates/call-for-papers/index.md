## Call for Papers

Softconf submission site: [https://softconf.com/naacl2025/CLPsych2025/](https://softconf.com/naacl2025/CLPsych2025/)

Since 2014, CLPsych has brought together researchers in computational linguistics and NLP, who use computational methods to better understand human language, infer meaning and intention, and predict individuals’ characteristics and potential behavior, with mental health practitioners and researchers, who are focused on psychopathology and neurological health and engage directly with the needs of providers and their patients. This workshop’s distinctly interdisciplinary nature has improved the exchange of knowledge, fostered collaboration, and increased the visibility of mental health as a problem domain in NLP.

Together, we hope to be able to advance the common goal of using human language as a tool to better understand emotional and mental state, and to reduce emotional suffering and the potential for self-harm. In this year, we will focus on the theme: understanding the mental health state and its changes as opposed to focusing on one final label or output.

### Paper submission instructions

All paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. In addition to papers describing algorithms, models, or experimentation, we are happy to receive carefully argued and supported position papers, insightful reviews or synthesis of relevant literature, or informative descriptions of real-world experiences deploying language technology (including prototypes) in relevant clinical settings. Topics include, but are not limited to

 * Understanding people who are difficult to reach
 * Serving people who are traditionally less likely to seek and receive help
 * Addressing social or digital exclusion
 * Creating stronger links between patients and providers
 * Addressing the needs of underrepresented communities
 * Machine learning methods
 * Large language models
 * Linguistic methods and questions
 * Data collection and annotation
 * Specific conditions (e.g. autism spectrum, depression, etc.)
 * Practical deployment of technology
 * Clinical assessment
 * Clinical research
 * Therapy
 * Explainability and interpretability
 * Position papers
 * Ethics and limitations

A key goal of this workshop is to foster the conversation with clinicians and clinical researchers, both at the workshop and when these papers are read in the future. We therefore include practicing clinicians and clinical researchers on our program committee, and the ability to communicate ideas, approaches, and results clearly to people who are not computational linguists will be as important as the technical quality of the work.

CLPsych submissions should be submitted using Softconf. CLPsych will accept submissions of both long papers (up to eight pages of core content) and short papers (up to four pages of core content); plus unlimited references. Up to an extra page can be added in the final camera-ready version to allow space for addressing the reviewers’ comments. We require all authors to include relevant discussions of ethical considerations, impact, and limitations in the body of the paper. The limitations section does not count toward the page limit and should appear immediately before the references section. Following NAACL’s policy, papers without a limitations section will be desk-rejected.

Authors may optionally include appendices, but these constitute additional information and might not be looked at by reviewers. If anything in the appendix is an important part of the contribution, or important for the reviewers to assess the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. 

All submissions must be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy. Insufficiently anonymized submissions and submissions that do not respect the anonymity period will be desk-rejected.

Authors should adhere to NAACL 2025 submission policy and requirements that are posted at [https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information) with respect to author guidelines, double submission, anonymity period, double blind review, data management, human subjects discussion, referencing prior work, and templates.

In order for the paper to appear in the proceedings, at least one author must register for the workshop by the early registration deadline. Authors of accepted papers will be asked to provide a pre-recorded video presenting their work and to participate in discussant-led sessions, in which their paper will be discussed.

### Important dates
